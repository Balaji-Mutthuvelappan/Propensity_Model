The model was developed in response to a request from the Dermstore team, who wanted to identify the next best category to recommend to customers.
To address this, we built the model using the ALS (Alternating Least Squares) algorithm.

The model undergoes continuous training every three months to account for category shifts and maintain its accuracy.

In the future, we plan to enhance the model by incorporating additional features such as clicks, sessions, and other user interaction metrics â€” once the Dermstore team begins actively using it.
